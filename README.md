# juki_nozzle_changer

## JUKI 50x nozzle changer using wtih Ray Kholodovsky's holder.

Nozzle mating sequence:

 1. Holder moves down at the nozzle locating home position while outer ring sleeve moves toward upside enough.
 2. Holder slides and leaves home with the nozzle dragging together.
 3. Nozzle moves upward a little bit and connects with the holder (at the top surface horizontal part).
 4. Outher ring sleeve moves downward and expand spring fully (at the top surface down slope part).
 5. Nozzle leaves from the changer and mating process is done.

Inspired by 'Pick-and-place automatic nozzle changer' - Karl Ekdahl.

Assembly:

Please use a wide and flat sanding file for better adhering parts together, also use fine sanding files to make top surface and sliding rails smooth. Teflon spray coating may prolong the life of there parts. You will need a good plastic adhesive cement for final assembly.
